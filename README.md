# Tasks+
### Made by Siddhant Madhur

## What is its purpose?
I made Tasks+ to jumpstart my journey in learning C# and the WPF library.
It is a very simple task managing app with only the ability to add and remove tasks.

I am aiming to make it a feature clone of [Reminders+](https://github.com/SiddhantMadhur/remindersplus) so I get accustomed to making apps with C# the same way I am with making websites with HTML and JavaScript.
